Pi Weather Station
==================

This is a small Java project geared to run on the Raspberry Pi, but it should
run on any system with Java.  I wrote it initially to fill up space on a monitor
I used as an accurate clock with an Internet connected device using NTP (Network
Time Protocol) and dclock.  As it came together I thought it would be a fun
project for anyone with a spare monitor and $35 to spend on a Raspberry Pi.
